# Babel-Babel manufacturing

The following operations must be performed for Babel-Babel manufacturing:

1) SMT mounting of the main PCB.

2) Flashing both Babels and [Dronecode probe](https://github.com/Zubax/dronecode_probe) on the PCB.
This operation should be performed without installing any connectors on the PCB,
a 4-pin pogo pin connector should be used instead.
Connectors' pinouts used for flashing can be found in the picture below.

3) After flashing is done, all the PCBs should be stacked, aligned,
and secured together using x5 2 mm diameter pins.
"Part A" PCBs should be split in two parts beforehand,
and the excessive material that interferes with USB A connector placement should be removed.
The pins can be manufactured by cutting widely available round wooden dowels 
with 2 mm diameter to appropriate length (7.7 mm).
The dowels can be purchased in general hardware stores 
or on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wooden-Sticks-Round-Dowels-Natural/dp/B07T4ZFFHQ)
and other online shops.
